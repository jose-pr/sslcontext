# `sslcontext` — public API header

Header-file-style reference for the `sslcontext` package: every public export with
its signature, arguments, contract and gotchas, so the package can be used
without reading its source. It ships inside the package and is
self-contained. Development documentation lives with the source at
<https://github.com/jose-pr/sslcontext>.

Import everything from the root `sslcontext`, except the errors, which live in
`sslcontext.exceptions` and are re-exported from the root. Modules whose
names start with `_` are private.

`pip install sslcontext`. No runtime dependencies.

`sslcontext.__version__` is the installed distribution's version.
